  "summary": "The  respondents cannot therefore claim that the loss of the  goods was explosion damage within the meaning of the  Ordinance so as to bring the case within section 14 and  at the same time contend that the loss was not \"due  to or did not in any way arise ont of the explosion\" in  order to a void the bar under section 18.. The jurisdiction of the High Court in the matter of income­ tax references is an advisory jurisdiction and under the Inco:ne­ tax Act the decision of the Appellate Tribunal on facts is final  unless it can be successfully assailed on the ground tha~ there was ,_   S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1009  no evidence for the conclusions on facts recorded by the Tribnnal.. The Appellate Tribunal found that the assessees had  agreed to pay off the decree a1nount from the remuneration due to  them, that the decre.e was passed against them evidently for some  misfeasance committed by their directors, that the books of both  companies showed that the assessees were paid their remunera­ tion in full, and that the expenditure was not therefore laid out  for the purpose of carrying on the business, and also that, as the  payment was made for the liquidation of a debt, it was not a  revenue expenditure.. lt appears  that certain hundis were drawn by one of the directors  of the respondent company, acting in the capacity of  the managing agents of the :Mill Company, in the name  of the Mill Company and the same were negotiated to  others.. The Mill Company repudiated its  liability as it appeared from the books of the Mill  Company that they had not the use of the sum of  Rs. 1.80,000 claimed by the Nath Bank Ltd.. 1683, 1720, 1735 and 1757 of 1939 for the said  aggregate sum of Rs. 1,80,000 and the interest thereon  AND WHEREAS the said Mills have been advised to  settle the said suits amicably AND WHEREAS the  Calcutta Agency Limited by its Directors, S.N. Mitter  or S.C. Mitter, having been and being still the Manag- ing Agents of the said Mills have undertaken to  reimburse the said Mills in respect of the decrees to oe  made in the said four suits in the manner hereinafter  appearing NOW THESE PRESENTS WITNESS  AND IT IS HEREBY AGREED AND DECLARED  (i) That out of the commission of 3% payable by  the said Mills to the said Agency under Regulation 131  of the Articles of Association of the Company, the  Company shall have paramount lien on and deduct  and set off a moiety thereof against any payment  which the said Mills may make in respect of the decrees  or any of them and/or costs of the said suits.. (xv) any expenditure (not being in the nature  of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the  assessee) laid out or expended wholly and exclusively  for the purpose of such business, profession or voca­ tion.\"  In the statement of the case submitted by the  Tribunal after reciting the fact of the incorporation of  the company and the terms of the compromise mention­ ed above, the arguments urged on behalf of the assessee  company have been recapitulated.. The next argu­ ment of the respondents was that in respect of  Rs. 22,500 it was entitled to exemption under section  10(2) (xv) of the Income-tax Act on the ground that  the payment was an expenditure which was not in the  nature of a capital expenditure or personal expenses of  the applicant company but was an expenditure laid  out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of its busi­ ness.. This statement of the case prepared by the Income­ tax Tribunal and submitted to the High Court for its  opinion was perused by the parties and they had no  suggestions to make in respect of the same.. \" Applying this line of reasoning the High  Court differed from the conclusion of the Tribunal and  allowed the deduction to the respondent company under  section 10(2) (xv) of the Income-tax Act, as claimed by  the respondents.. in the matter of income-tax references is an advisory Calcutta Agency  jurisdiction and under the Act the decision of the Ltd.. It  is therefore the duty of the High Court to start by  looking at the facts found by the Tribunal and answer  the questions of law on that footing.. The statement of the case under  the rules framed under the Income-tax Act is prepared  with the knowledge of the parties concerned and they  have a full opportunity to apply for any addition or  deletion from that statement of the case.. It is therefore clear  that it was the duty of the High Court to start with  that statement of the case as the final statement of  facts.. Nowhere in the statement  of the case prepared by the Tribunal and filed in the  High Court, the Tribunal had come to the conclusion  that the payment was made by the assessee company  to avoid any danger of public exposure or to save itself  from scandal or in order to maintain the managing  agency of the appellant company.. Instead of first ascertaining what were the facts found  by the Tribunal in the present case, the process was  reversed and the procedure adopted was to take Mit­ chell's case(1) as the law and argue that the facts in the  present case covered the situation.. to proved that the borrowing is for the purpose of the  business and the loan was u:sed in the business, the  interest cannot be allowed under section 10(2)(iii).\"  The second objection raised before the Appellate  Assistant Commissioner was in these terms:-·' That  the Income-tax Officer should have allowed the said sum  of Rs. 22,500 as allowable expenditure being alloca­ tion of a sum out of the revenue receipt before it became  income in the hands of the assessee.\" The wording of  the objection and the argument noticed in the order of  the Appellate Assistant Commissioner show that the  contention was that this sum should be treated as not  having become the income of the assessee at all because  it was deducted at the source by the Mill company.. therefore, this appeal should be  allowed on the simple ground that the facts necessary  to be established by the respondents to support their  claim for exemption under section 10 (2) (xv) of the  Indian Income-tax Act have not been established at  any stage of the proceedings and therefore they are  not entitled to the deduction claimed.",

  "summary": "•  1952 -The State of  Bihar  v.. (ii) The obligation to pay compensation for property  acquired by the State is not an obligation imposed by entry 36  of List II read by itself or in conjunction with entry 42 of List III  or by the spirit of the Constitution.. Per DAs /.- Assuining that the obligation to pay compensation is also  implicit in entry 36 of List II, in itself or read with entry 42 of  List III, even then the validity of the Act cannot be questioned  by reason of arts.. The words \"subject to\" in entry 36 of List II only mean  that whenever a law is made by a State Legislature in exercise  of its legislative power under entry 36, that law will be subject  to the provisions of a law made by the Parliament under entry 42  of List III.. Though the  main object of the Act, viz., the acquisition of estates, is for a  public purpose, the acquisition of arrears of rent due to the  zamindars on payment of 50 per cent.. J.-Whatever may be the pc>1t10n as  regards the acquisition of money as such it is not correct to say  that a law made under entry 36 of List II cannot authorise  acquisition of choses in action like arrears 'of rent due from the  tenants which are covered by the term \"property\" used in that  entry and in art.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. Entry 36  of List II read with article 246(3) was obviously in- tended to authorise a State Legislature to exercise the  right of eminent domain, that is, the right of compul- sory acquisition of private property, The exercise of  such power has been recognised in· the jurisprudence of  all civilised countries as conditioned by public neces- sity and payment of compensation.. The words \"sub- ject to the provisions of entry 42 of List III\" in entry 36  reinforce the argument, as these words must be taken  to mean that the power to make a law with respect to  acquisition of property should be exercised subject to  the condition that such law should also provide for  the matters referred to in entry 4 2, in other words, a  two-fold restriction as to public purpose and payment  .. ( 4) If any bill pending at the commencement of  this Constitution in the Legislature of a State has,  after it has been passed by such Legislature, been  reserved for the consideration of the President and  has received his assent, then, notwithstanding any- thing in this Constitution, the law so assented to shall  not be called in question in any court on the ground  that it contravenes the provisions of clause (2).. (5) Nothing in clause (2) ~hall affect- ( a) The provisions of any existing law other than  a law to which the provisions of clause (6) apply, or  (b) the provisions of any law which the State  may hereafter make- (i) for the purpose of imposing or levying any tax  or penalty, or  (ii) for the promotion of public health or the pre- vention of danger to life or property, or  (iii) in pursuance of any agreement entered into  between the Government of the Dominion of India or  the Government of India and the Government of any  other country, or otherwise, with respect to property  declared by law to be evacuee property ........ Saving of laws providing for acquisition of  estates, etc.-(1) Notwithstanding anything in the  foregoing provision;; of this Part no law providing for  the acquisition by the State of any e.state or of any  rights therein or for the extinguishment or modifica- tion of any such rights, shall be deemed to be void on  the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away  or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provi- sions of this Part : .....• ' - ' 31-B.. On  the other hand, the law referred to m article 31(4)  covers acquisition of any kind of property, while  ., article 31-A relates only to the acquisition of a parti- cular kind of property, viz., estates and rights there- in, and what is more important for our present  purpose, the non obstante clause in article 31 ( 4) over- rides all other provisions in the Constitution including  the List of the Seventh Schedule, whereas a law which  falls within the purview of article 31-A could only  prevail over \"the foregoing provisions of this Part\".. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. In the face of the limitations on the  State's power of compulsory acquisition t'hus incor- porated in the body of the Constitution, from which  \"estates\" alone are excluded, it would, in my opinion,  be contrary to elementary canons of statutory con- struction to read, by implication, those very limita- tions into entry 36 of List II, alone or in conjunction  with entry 42 of list III of the Seventh Schedule, or to  deduce them from \"the spirit of the Constitution\",  and that, c too, in respect of the very properties  excluded.. The entries in the Lists of the  Seventh Schedule are designed to define and delimit  the respective areas of legislative competence of the  Union and State Legislatures, and such context is  hardly appropriate for the imposition of implied res- triictions on the exercise of legislative powers, which  are ordinarily matters for positive enactment in the  body of the Constitution.. ~t was suggested that the laws referred  to in sub-clause (b) of clause (5) are laws made in  exercise of the taxing power or the police power of  the State as the case may be, and that the sub-clause  was inserted only by way of abundant caution.. under heads (2) and (3) of sub- clause (b) must necessarily be referable to, and derive  their competence from the legislative power under  entry 36 of List II, in so far as they purport to autho- rise acquisition of any property, for the police power  of the State is only the general power to regulate and  control the exercise of private rights and lioerties in  the interests of the community and does not represent  any specific head of legislative power.. It was said that the words \"subject to the  provisions of entry 42 in List III\" must be taken to  mean that the law-making power under entry 36  could only be exercised subject to the two conditions  as to public purpose and payment of compensation,  both of which are referred to in entry.. Tha.t they  cannot bear the interpretation sought to • be put upon  them by Mr. Das is clear from the fact that similar  words do not occur in entry 33 of List I which confers  on Parliament the power of making laws with respect  to acquisition or requisitioning of property for the  purposes of the Union.. The fact is that the law-making power of both Parlia- ment and State Legislatures can be exercised only  subject to the aforesaid two restrictions, not by reason  of anything contained in the entries themselves, but  by reason of the positive provisions of article 31 (2),  and, as laws falling under article 31 ( 4) or under  articles 31-A and 31-B cannot be called in question  in a court of law for non-compliance with those pre>- visions, such laws cannot be struck down as uncon- stitutional and void.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. The State of  Bihar  v.. Article 31 (4), for instance, speaks of a \"bill\"  being reserved for the President's assent \"after it has  been passed\" by the \"legislature of a State\" and of  \"the law so assented to.\" If the expression \"passed  by the legislature\" were taken to mean \"passed  by the Houses of the legislature and assented to  by the Governor\" as Mr. Somayya would have  it understood, then, it would cease to be a \"bill\"  and could no longer be reserved as such.. Turning now to the special points ansmg in parti- cular cases, it was urged by Mr. Das that section 4(b)  of the Bihar Act, which provides that all arrears of  rent, royalti~ and cesses due for any period prior to  the date of the vesting of the estates in Government  \"shall vest and be recoverable by the State\" was un- constitutional and void.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. Whatever may be the position as  regards the acquisition of money as such, it is not  correct to say that a law made under entry 36 of List  II cannot authorise acquisition of choses in action like  arrears of rent due from the tenants which are covered  by the term \"property\" used in that entry and in  article 31.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. It was argued  that, whik' the Constitution conferred power on the  legislatures under entry 42 of List III to make laws  with respect to the principles on which compensa- tiop for property acquired was to be determined  and the form and the mauner m wji.ich such  compensation was to be given, it was not com- petent for the Bihar Legislature to delegate this essen- tial legislative power to the executive government.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. Mr. Somayya raised a further contention that in  regard to the malguzari lands covered by the Madhya  Pradesh Act, articles 31-A and 31-B could be of no  assistance to the Government, as such lands are not  \"estates\" within the meaning of clause (2) of article  31-A with the result that the objection based on  article 14 as to discrimination in the matter of pay- ment of compensation must prevail.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. On the same day, a  notification under section 3 of the Act was published  stating that the estates and tenures belonging to the  respondent and two others passed to and became  vested in th~ State of Bihar under the provisions of  the Act.. That the vesting of the estates in the State of  Bihar under the Act being in effect an acquisition of  the estates, it was invalid as that acquisition was not  for a public purpose and the provision for compen- sation was illusory.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. •  1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. In view of the Amendment Act any  argu_ment regarding the unconstitutionality of the  Bihar Act based on the ground that the prov1s1ons  of that Act contravened articles 14, 19 or 31  of the Constitution does not survive and the Act is  not open to challenge on any such ground.. As the  Act has been held' invalid by the High Court solely on  the ground that it violated the provisions of article 14  of the Constitution, the basis of the judgment declaring  the Act to be unconstitutional is no longer tenable  and it has therefore to be reversed in case this Court  agrees with the decision of the High Court oii the  points decided against the respondent.. Das for the respondent frankily conceded  that no objection to the validity of the Act at this  stage could be raised on the ground that it contra- vened any of the provisions of Part III of the Con- stitution.. Das's attack on the  vires of the Act mainly rests on the contention that it  is implicit within the language of entry 36 of List II  of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution that pro- perty could not be acquired without payment of com- pensation, the only effect of a compulsory power of  acquisition against the individual being that there is  the power to oblige him to sell and convey property  when the public necessities require it, but that the  power to take compulsorily raises by implication a  right to payment ; in other words, there is a con- comitant obligation to pay and the power to acquire  is inseparable from the obligation to pay compen- sation and as the provisions of the statute in respect  of payment of compensation are illusory, it is uncon- stitutional.. The provisions of articles 31(4) and  31-A and 31-B, though they deprive the expropriated  proprietor of his rights provided in Part III of the  Constitution, do not in any way affect the ambit of  entry 36 and empower the State Legislature to make  a law for compulsory acquisition of property without  payment of compensation in the true sense of that term.. Emphasis is laid on the words \"subject to the provi- sions of entry 42\" contained in entry 36 and it is  contended that the exercise of legislative power under 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. It is also  said that the Bihar Legislature had legislated both  under entry 36 and entry 42 and intended to take the  property conditional on payment of compensation but  if it transpires that the provisions it has made about  payment of compensation are illusory, then that part  of the Act would be void and as it could not have been  intended by the legislature to pass the Act in any  truncated form in which it would remain if the provi- sions regarding compensation are taken out of it, the  whole Act should be held unconstitutional.. To appreciate the contentions raised by Mr. Das on  the question of the competence of the Bihar Legisla- ture to enact the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, it is  necessary to refer to its provisions and to see on what  subjects the legislature has purported to enact the  law.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 923  to the State under the provisions of section 11 and  they are to be deemed to be leased by the State to the  lessee with effect from the date of vesting.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. Having held that the Bihar Act is constitutional as  regards transfer of estates to the State and that this  is mainly an enactment under legislative head 36 of  Lis:t II, it is convenient now to examine the conten- tion of Mr. Das to the effect that in the contents of  the power conferred on the legislature by this entry  their exists a concomitant obligation to pay compen- sation and that as the provisions regarding payment of  compensation are illusory, the Act i:s unconstitutional  and that article 31 ( 4) of the Constitution does not  afford any protection against this attack.. Das that the obligation to pay  compensation is implicit in the language of entry 36 of  List II of the Seventh Schedule and that the power to  take compulsorily raises by implication a right to  payment, the power to acquire being inseparable from  the obligation to pay compensation, it is necessary to  examine briefly the origin of the power of the State on  the subject of compulsory acquisition of property.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. Power to take was mentioned in entry 36,  while the condition for the exercise of· that power  was embodied in article 31 (2) and there was no duty  to pay compensation implicit in the content of the  entry itself.. It is  by force of the provisions of article 31 (2) that it be- comes obligatory to legislate providing for compen- sation under entry 42 of the Concurrent List in order  to give validity to a law enacted under entry 36 and  not by reason of the use of the words \"subject to\" in  the wording of the entry.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 932 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]  Lastly, it was urged that the legislative power  conferred in entry 42 of the Concurrent List is a power  conferred for the benefit of the expropriated owner  and that the legislature is bound to exercise this  power for his benefit whenever it takes property under  its compulsory powers, in other words, it was said  that the power conferred by the entry was coupled  with a duty to exercise it.. The crucial point for determination in these appeals  h to discover the extent to which article 31 ( 4) of  the Constitution or the new articles 31-A and 31-B  have deprived the expropriated proprietor of his  rights or remedies in respect of this matter and of the  guaranteed right to get compensation for property  acquired.. '  .~  S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 933  reserved for the consideration of · the President and  has received his assent, then notwithstanding any-'  thing in this Constitution, the law so assented to shall  not be called in question in any court on the ground  that it contravenes the provisions of clause (2) .\"  Articles 31-A and 31-B are in these terms:- \"31-A.. (1) Notwithstanding anything in the fore- going provisions of this Part, no law providing for the  acquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights  therein or for the extinguishment or modification of  any such rights shall be deemed to be void on the  ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or  abridges any of the rights conferred by any pro- visions of this Part :  Provided that where such law is a law made by  the Legislature of a State, the provisions of this  Article shall not apply thereto unless such law,  having been reserved for the consideration the Presi- dent has received his assent.. Without prejudice to the generality of the  provisions contained in article 31-A, none of the Acts  and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule nor  any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be  void or even to have become void, on the ground that  such Act, Regulation or provision is inconsistent with,  or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred  by any provisions of this Part, and notwithstanding  any jmlgment, decree or order of any court or tribunal 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 934 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]  to the contrary, each of the said Acts and Regulations  shall, subject to the power of any competent legislature  to repeal or amend it, continue in force.\"  The language of article 31 ( 4) is unequivocal in its  terms and states that when a Bill has received the  assent of the President according to the procedure  prescribed in article 31(3) and (4) then, notwithstand- ing anything in this Constitution, the law so assented  to shall not be called in question in any court on the  ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause (2).. The words of  the clause preceding the word \"unless\" are merely  descriptive of the law, the validity of which would be  questionable if there was no provision for determina- tion and for payment of compensation for the property  taken in its contents.. The existence of a \"public  purpose\" is undoubtedly an implied condition of the  exercise of compulsory powers of acquisition by the  State, but the language of article 31(2) does A not ... The exercise of the power to acquire  compulsorily is conditional on the existence of a public  purpose and that being so, this condition is not an  express provision of article 31(2) but exists aliunde  in the content of the power itself and that in fact is  the assumption upon which this clause of the article  proceeds.. The result of this discussion is that the scope  of article 31 ( 4) is limited to the express provisions of  article 31 (2) and courts cannot examine either the  extent or the adequacy of the prov1S1ons of com- pensation contained in any law dealing with the 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. As regards the new articles 31-A and 31-B, they  merely place beyond the reach of the c;ourt any enact- ment dealing with compulsory acquisition of property  which may infringe any of the provisions of Part III  of the Constitution ; in other words, article 13(2) of  the Constitution cannot be called in aid to impugn the  validity of such statutes.. It may be the purpose of the  Union, or the purpose of the State or any other public  purpose.. The learned Judges of the High Court  negatived this conten.tion on the ground that the ques- tion whether there was a public purpose in support of  the acquisition of the estates had been by implication  decided by the Constituent Assembly and therefore  the Court could not go into this matter.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. Learned counsel challenged this view of the High  Court and contended that article 31 ( 4) of the Constitu- tion is no answer on this point and that the Act was  bad as it was silent on the question as to why the  zamindaris were being acquired ; that it only provided  for the interception of rents which instead of being  realized by the zami11dars would .. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. II  of Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, at page 744,  wherein it is said as follows :- \"The purpose must be public, and must have  reference to the needs or convenience of the public,  and no reason of general pnblic policy will be sufficient  to validate other transfers when they concern existing  vested rights.\"  Finally, it was urged tl1at there was nothing definite  or tangible in the Act or in the views of the legisla- tures which gave any indication of the public purpose  for which the estates were being acquired and all that  could be gathered was that the legislature did not  know its own mind at all and on a vague notion of some  future policy directed the acquisition of the estates.. manner of doubt that acquisition of private property  by legislation under entries 33, 36 and 42 can only be  made either for purposes of the Union or for purposes  of the State or for a public purpose and that it is un- •1ecessary to state in express terms in the statute itself  tne precise purpose for which property is being taken,  nrovided from the whole tenor and inten<lment of the  Act it could be gathere<l that the property was being  acquired either for purposes of the State or for pur- poses of the public and that the intention was to  benefit the community at large.. Article 39 of the Directive Principles of  State Policy states as follows :-- \"The State shall, in particular, direct its policy  t!owards securing that the ownership and control of  the material resources of the community are so dis- tributed as best to subserve the common good ; and  that the operation of the economic system does not  result in the concentration of wealth and means of  production to the common detriment.\"  Now it is obvious that concentration of big blocks of  land in the hands of a few individuals is contrary to  the principle on which the Constitution of India 1s  based.. The purpose of the acquisition contemplated  by the impugned Act therefore is to clo away with the  concentrat;on of big blocks of land ancl means of pro- duction in the hands of a few individuals and to so  distribute the ownership and control of the material  resources which come m the hands of the State as to  subserve the common good as best as possible.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. • S.C.R.

In a nutshell, it was contended  that the object of the Act was to acquire properties of  the zemindars by payment of compensation (so-called)  out of the moneys belonging to the zemindars them- selves and that in some cases they had not only to  give up their estates for nothing but would have to  pay something, in addition, to the State, if the prin- ciples specified in the Act were to apply.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. It may be that  some of the provisions of the Act may operate harshly  on certain persons or a few of the zamindars and may  be bad if they are in excess of the legislative power  of the Bihar Legislature but from that circumstance  it does not follow that the whole enactment is a fraud  on the Constitution.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]  without payment of compensation, one cannot j~mp  to the conclusion that the whole of the enactment ts a  fraud on the Constitution or that all the provisions as to  payment of compensation are illusory.. The entry reads tfius:- \"Principles on which compensation for property  acquired or requisitioned for purposes of the Union or  of a State or for any other public purpose is to be  determined, and the form and manner in which such  compensation is to be given.\"  This head of legislation seems to have been expressly  mentioned in the Concurrent List not only in view of  the accepted principle of law that in cases of compul- sory acquisition of property compensation has to be  made but also in view of the clear and mandatory  provisions of article 31(2) which require that a law  authorising the taking or acquisition of propeny will  be void if it does not provide for payment of compen- sation for the property acquired or does not either fix  the amount of compensation or specify the principles  on which and the manner in which the compensation  is to be determined and given.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. Firstly, it was said that the Constitution  having _in entry 42 of List III of the Seventh Schedule  vested authority in the legislature to make laws on  the question of the principles as to the payment of  compensation and the manner and form of its payment,  in other words, it h;, ving trusted these matters to the  care, judgment and wisdom of the legislature, it had  no power to delegate these matters to the executive.. What has been left to  the executive is the question of the determination of  proportion in which compensation is to be paid in  cash or in bonds and the fixation of the interval of the  instalments.. The proportion in which compensation was payable in  cash or in bonds or whether the whole of it was to be  paid in cash is a matter which only the State Govern- ment could fix and similarly, the interval of instal- ments and the period of redeemability of the bonds  were also matters of detail which the; · executive could  (1) [1951] S.C.R. 51.. Mr. Choudhury contended that the  field of legislation on the question of principles of  determination of compensation and the mode and  manner of payment of such compensation was already  occupied by the Land Acquisition Act which was an  existing law of Parliament and, t~refore, the State  Legislature could not enter on this field and legislate  on the principles of payment of compensation.. As regards section 23(f) the Bihar Land Reforms  Act, my learned brother has based his decision on the  ground that the provision of this clause constitutes a  fraud on the Constitution, and although in enacting  the provision, the legislature purported to exer- cise its powers under entry 42 of the Legisla- tive List III in Schedule VII of the Constitution,  in reality i:t is a colourable exercise of that power  under which a thing has been done wliich is  not contempleted by that entry at all and lies  outside its ambit.. This condition is implied in the  provision of :irticle 31 (2) of the Constitution and  although the enactment in the present case fulfills  the requirements of clause (3) of article 31 and as 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 958 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]  such attracts the operation of clause (4) of that  article, my learned brother has takien the view that  the bar created ·by cleause ( 4) is confined to the ques- tion of compensation only and does not extend to the  existence or necessity of a public purpose which,  though implicit in, has not been expressly provided  for by clause (2) of the article.. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 959  The arrears of rent whether merged in decrees or  not, whic.h were due to the landlord for a period ante- rior to the date of notification under section 3(1) of the  Act, were undoubtedly the property of the landlord,  irrespective of his interest in the estate or tenure which  is the subject-matter of acquisition.. Possibly under the impression that the sacredness of  private property should not be confided to the un- certain virtues of the party in power for the time  being, the Constitution-makers of our country have  declared it as one of the fundamental rights that no  property shall be taken possession of or acquired for  public purpose unless the law directing its appropriation  makes provision for compensation in the manner laid  down in article 31 ( 2).. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. Clause ( 4) (b) of the impugned Act read with the  provision of section 24 of the same, empowers the  State Government to appropriate all the arrears of  rent due to a landlord at a particular time and the  only obligation it casts on the Government in this  respect is to allow 50\"/o of the amount thus appro- priated as sol'lllium for the so-called acquisition.. On  the face of it the legislative provision purports to  have been made in exercise of the powers conferred on  the State legislature under entry 36 of List II and  entry 42 of List III of Schedule, VII of the Constitu- tion.. In my opinion, this is a mere device or pretence  and the real object which the legislation intended to  accomplish is to deprive a man of his money which is  not ordinarily a subject-matter of acquisition, in exer- cise of what are known as powers of eminent domain  by the State, without giving him anything in ex- change; and under the guise of acting under entry 42  of List III, the legislature has in truth and substance  evaded and nullified its provisions altogether.. Money in the hands of a citizen can be  reached by the exercise of the power of taxation, it  may be confiscated as a penalty under judicial order  and we can even conceive of cases where the State seizes  -or confiscates money belonging to or in the hand~ of a  citizen under the exercise of its 'police' powers on the  ground that such fund may be used for unlawful pur- poses to the detriment of the interest of the community.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. This is a descrip- tion of legislative head and I agree with the learned  Attorney-General that in deciding the competency of the  legislation under this entry, we are not concerned with  the justice or propriety of the principles upon which the  assessment of compensation is to be made under a parti- cular legislation nor are we concerned with the justice·  or otherwise of the form or manner in which such  compensation is to be given.. Stripped of all dis- guise, the net result of the impugned provision is that  it would be open to the State Government to appro- priate to itself half of the arrears of rent due to the  landlord prior to the date of the acquisition without  giving him any compensation whatsoever.. It has been suggested  in course of the argument on behalf of the State that  in the present case the Government in the exercise of  its powers of acquisition could acquire the arrears of  rent and as the arrears were still unrealised, it was  quite legitimate and proper for the Government to  deduct half of the gross amount as consideration for  the trouble and expense that it would have to undergo  in the matter of realising these arrears.. The High· Court rejected the plea  of the State that article 31 ( 4) of the Constitution by  reason of the words \"notwithstanding anything in  this Constitution\" excluded article 14 at least in its  application to the alleged inequality of compensation.. Article 31(4) is in these terms:- \"lf any Bill pending at the commencement of this  Constitution in the Legislature of a State has, after it  has been passed by such Legislature, been reserved for  the consideration of the President and has received  his assent, then, notwithstanding anything in this  Constitution, the law so assented to shall not be  called in question in any court on the ground  that it contravenes the provisions of clause (2).\"  .. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. therein or for the extinguishment or  modification of any such rights shall be deemed to be  void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or  takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by  any provisions of this Part :  Provided that where such law is a law made by the  Legislature of a State, the provisions of this article  shall not apply thereto unless such law, having been  reserved for the consideration of the President, has  recdved his assent.. Learned counsel appearing for the respondents  accept the position that as a result of the con- stitutional amendments tl1e impugned Act has  been removed from the operation of the provisions  of Part III of the Constitution including article 14  and that the respondents cannot, therefore, complain  of the breach of the equal protection of the laws under  arcicle 14 which was the only ground on which the  respondents succeeded in the High Court.. Learned  counsel, however, maintain that although they cannot  now challenge the constitutionality of the Act on the  ground that it contravenes or is inconsistent with or  takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by  any of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution ;  it is, nevertheless, open to them to call the Act into  question on other grounds founded on other parts of  the Constitution or on general principles of law.. Even if the Court does not accept the correct- ness of the arguments based on entry 36 in List II and  entry 42 in List III and holds the respondents barred  from going into the question of compensation by reason  of articles 31(4), 31-A and 31-B the respondents are  still entitled to challenge the Act on the ground that  the proposed acquisition is not for a public purpose.. Nor is it claimed, in  view of articles 31( 4), 31-A and 31-B, that it is still  open to the respondents to call in question the valid- ity of the impugned Act on the ground that it  contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or  abridges the provision for compensation made in  article 31(2).. That the obligation to  pay just compensation for compulsory acquisition of  private property is a principle of natural equity re- cognised by all temperate and civilized governments,  that the right to compensation is an incident to the  exercise of the power of eminent domain and that the  one is so inseparably connected with the other that  they may be siaid to exist, not as separate and distinct  principles but, as parts of one and the same principle  are well-established by a series of decisions of the  American courts quoted by Harlan J.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. • 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. Further, the impugned Act purports to  acquire all arrears of rent and a la~ for acquisition of  the arrears of rent cannot possibly be said to be a  law with respect to matters specified in entry 18  in List II for it cannot be supposed to be a law  relating to the collection of rent within the meaning  of that entry.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 974 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]  necessity of constitutional law that I know of, or that  has been brought to our notice, which requires that  the obligation to pay compensation for the acquisition  of property must be made part and parcel of the very  legislative power to make a law with respect to the  compulsory acquisition of private property.. We find that under article 246 Parliament  has exclusive power to make laws with respect, inter  ulia, to matters specified in entry 33 in List I, namely,  \"acquisition or requisitioning of property for the pur- poses of the Union, that the State Legislatures have  exclusive power to make laws with respect, inter  alia, to matters specified in entry 36 in List II, namely,  the \"acquisition or requisitioning of property except  for the purposes of the Union subject to the provision  of entry 42 of List III\" and that both Parliament and  the State Legislatures may make laws with respect to  matters set forth in entry 42 in List III, namely, the  principles for determining the compensation and the  form and manner of giving such compensation.. This  legislative power of Parliament or of the State Legis- latures is, by article 245, made \"subject to the provi- sions of this Constitution.\" One of the provil;ions 0f  the Constitution is article 31 (2) under which no pro- perty can be \"taken possession of or acquired for  public purposes under any law authorising the taking  of such possession or such acquisition unless the law  provides for compensation for the property and either  fixes the amount of compensation or specifies the  principles on which, and the mam:1er in which, the  compensation is to be determined and given.\" The  scheme of our Constitution obviously is to provide the  three things separately, namely, the power of making a  law for acquisition of property in article 246 read  with entry 33 in List I and entry 36 in List II, the  obligation of such law to provide for compensation in  article 31 (2) and the power of making a law laying  down the · principles for determining such compen- sation in article 246 read with entry 42 in List III.. Das suggests, in the alternative, that if  the obligation to provide for compensation is not  implicit in the word \"acquisition\" itself as used in  entry 36 in List II that obligation is a~tracted and  made a part and pared of that entry by reason of  the words \"subject to the provisions of entry 42 of  List III\".. Das's argument would lead to this anomal- ous result that while the obligation to provide for  compensation is made a part of the legislative power  under entry 36 in List II by virtue of its last few  words quoted above, no such obligation is attractedt  and made part of the legislative power under entry 33  in List I, and that, therefore, in making a law with  respect to acquisition of property under entry 33 in  List I Parliament, unlike the State Legislatures, will  not be bound to provide for any compensation at all.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. Das reads  the words \"subject to\" as meaning \"conditional upon\"  the exercise of the legislative power under entry 42 in  List III, that is to say, conditional upon fulfilling the  obligation to provide for compensation and the form  and the manner in which such compensation is to be  given.. If entry 42 in List III were,  by reason of the words \"subject to the provisions of  entry 42 of List III\" occurring in -entry 36 in List II,  to be read as having been made a part of the content  of entry 36 in List II then it may well be argued  that, in view of article 246, .. Das finally urges that if the obligation to  provide for compensation is not implicit in the word  \"acquisition\" in entry 36 in List II and if that obliga- tion is not to be read into that entry even in view of  the words \"subject to ............... \" at the end of it,  even then if the State exercises its power to make a  law with respect to acquisition of property under  entry 36 in List II it is the duty of the State Legisla- ture to make a law also with respect to matJters speci- fied in entry 42 in List III on the principles that as •  •  .. a law for compulsory  acquisition of private property, to provide for com- pensation and either to fix the amount thereof or  specify the principles on which and the manner in  which the compensation is to be determined and given  is the provision of art'icle 31 (2).. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. Das's contentions were correct, a law for the  promotion of health or the prevention of danger to  life or property involving the acquisition of property  without a provision for compensation, which is what  is sought to be protected from article 31 (2), can never  be made, for the obligation to provide for compensa- tion is, according to him, implicit 'in entry 36 in  List II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List III, and  there is no other entry under which a law may be  made by a State Legislature with respect to acquisi- f1on of property.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 980 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]  The obligation to provide for compensation being, as  I hold, a provision of article 31 (2) and not being im- plicit m or a part and parcel of the legislative power  itself under entry 36 in List II read by itself or in  conjunction with entry 42 in List III, the impugned  Act cannot, by virtue of article 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B,  be called in question on the ground that it contravenes  or is 'inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any  of the rights conferred by the provisions of clause (2)  of a~ 'de 31, that is to say, that it does not provide  for compensation.. Assuming that the obligation to pay compensation  which is expressly provided in article 31 (2) ·is also  implicit in entry 36 in List II by itself or read with  entry 42 in List III the respo!ldents cannot, even  then, be permitted to call in question the validity of  the impugned Act on the ground that it does not pro- vide for compensation, for then they will be doing  exactly what they are forbidden to do by article 31  (4) and the newly added articles.. Article 31 (4) and the  added articles debar the respondents from questioning  the validity of the Act on the ground, inter alia, that  it contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or  abridges any of the rights conferred by the provisions  of clause (2) of article 31.. The emphasis in those  articles is rather on the \"provisions\" than on the  number of the article or the Part of the Constitution.. In my judgment the respondents are not, by reason of  articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B, entitled to call the Act  in question on the ground that it does not provide for  compensation, whether the ground ~s formulated as a  breach of article 31 (2) or of the implied provision, if  any,.. of the gross assets in the case of proprietors 1952  The State •f  Bihar  v.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. It is true that the percentage of costs of management  calculated on the basis of the income of a big estate is  less than that of a smaller estate, but it is quite clear  that the Act has fixed the scale of deducion under  this head and under the head of works of benefit  according to the capacity of the proprietor or tenure- holder to bear it.. On the other hand, even  if i;t is held that no principle has, in fact, been laid  down by the Act, as contended, then that fact not  only amounts to a breach of the provisions of entry 42  in List III but also constitues a breach of the provi- sions of article 31 (2) which clearly and emphatically re- quires the law to either fix the compensation or lay  down the principles on which and the manner in  which the compensation· is to be given and a breach  of this \"provision\", call it a provision of article 31 (2)  or one of entry 42 in List III, cannot, for reasons  already stated be questioned in view of articles 31 ( 4),  31-A and 31-B.. It should also be remembered that  article 31 ( 4) by reason of the words \"notwithstanding 1952  The State of  Bihar  v •  Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir  Kameshwar  Singh  of Darbhanga  and Others.. The State of  Bihar  v.. 984 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]  anything in this Constitution\" occurring therein  will also protect the Act even against the alleged  legislative incompetency arising out of the non- compliance with all provisions of the Constitution  relating to the payment of compensation or the exist- ence of a public purpose including the supposed re- quirement of producing actual compensation said to  be implicit in the provisions of entry 42 in List III.. In my judgment, the Act cannot be called in question  on the ground of legislative incompetence of the Bihar  Legislature to enact it under entry 36 in List II or  entry 42 in List III.. It is said that section 3 of the Act, which is its main  operative section, does not contemplate or authorise  the acquisition of arrears of rent at all, for the notifi- cation under that section only refers to the vesting of  the estates or tenures in the State.. This vesting of the  arrears of rent in the State necessarily implies the  transfer of the rights of the proprietors or tenure- holders to the State and this process must, therefore,  amount to the acquisition of that right by the State,  Therefore, in effect, the Act does contemplate the  acquisition of the arrears of rent by the State.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. S.C.R.

The contention put  forward on behalf of the respondents is that the neces- sity for the existence of a public purpose as a condi- tion precedent to compulsory acquisition of private  property is not a \"provision\" 0£ articl\\! 31 (2) but is a  requirement of entry 36 in List II or entry 42 in  List III.. It is, therefore, concluded that the only \"pro- vision\" of article 31 (2) is that the law autho- rising the taking of possession or the acquisition  of property for a public purpose must provide  for compensation and it is this \"provision\" only  that cannot be made a ground of attack on the  Act by reason of articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B of  the Constitution.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. \"  Put in the above form, the clause makes it clear at  once and beyond any shadow of doubt that there are  three limitations imposed upon the power of the State,  namely, (1) that the taking of possession or acquisition  of property must be for a public purpose, (2) that such  taking of possession or acquisition must be under a  law authorising such taking of possession or acquisition  and (3) that the law must provide for compensation 1952  The State of  Bihar  v .. Das/,  1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. I am, therefore,  clearly of opinion that the existence of a public pur- pose as a prerequisite to the exercise of the power of  compulsory acquisition is an essential and integral  part of the \"provisions\" of clause (2).. If the require- ment of a public purpose were not a provision of  article 31 (2), then it will obviously lead us to the un- tenable conclusion that Parliament will be free under  its residuary powers under article 248 and entry 97 of  List I of the Seventh Schedule to make a law for ac- quiring private property without any public purpose  at all and to the still more absurd result that while  Parliament will have to provide for compensation  under article 31 (2) in a law made by it for acquisitio•  of property for a public purpose it will not have to  make any provision for compensation in a law made  for acquisition of property to be made without a public  purpose.. The existence of a  public purpose as a condition precedent to the exercise  of the power of compulsory acquisition being then, as  I hold, a \"provision\" of article 31 (2), an infringement  of such a provision cannot, under articles 31 (4), 31-A  and 31-B, be put forward as a ground for questioning  the validity of the Act.. implicit in entry 36 in List II and  that the existence of a public purpose is also a re- quirement of entry 42 in List III which is made a  part of entry 36 in List II by virtue of the words  \"subject to\" etc., appearing at the end of that entry  and his conclusion is that in the absence of a public  purpose the Bihar Legislature had no legislative com- petency under those two entries to enact the impug- ned Act and that this ground of attack, is still available •  •  •  1  •  •  •  , S.C.R.

The  matters comprised in entry 42 in List III, as a legisla- tive head, are the principles for the determination of  compensation and the form and manner of giv'ing  the compensation for property which is described  as having been acquired· or requisitioned for  the stated purposes.. That entry cannot possibly  be regarded as a legislative head for acquisition  of property and much less is the purpose or  province of that entry to lay down any requirement  of a public purpose as a condition precedent for the 1952  The State of  Bihar  v •  Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir  Kameshwar  Singh  of Darbhanga  and Others.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. If the \"provision\" of clause (2)  of article 31 as to the necessity for the existence of a  public purpose as a prerequisite to compulsory acquisi- tion of property is also to be regarded as implicit in  those two legislative entries, surely articles 31 (4),  31-A and 31-B and in particular article 31 (4) which  contain the words \"notwithstanding anything in this  Constitution\" will protect the Act from such implied  prov!S!on, for reasons I have already explained.. Assuming that the necessity for the existence of a  public purpose is not a provision of article 31 (2) but is  a provision only of entry 36 in List II and/or of  entry 42 in List III and that consequently articles 31 ( 4 ),  31-A and 31-B do not preclude the respondents from  challenging the validity of the Act on the ground of  the legislative incompetency arising out of the absence  of a public purpose, the question still remains whether  there is in fact a public purpose within the meaning of  our Constitution to support the Act.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v..

In 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. .I 1952  The State· of  Bihar  v.. Further,  it must always be borne in mind that the object of  .the impugned Act is not to authorise the stray acquisi- tion of a particular property for a limited and narrow  public purpose but that its purpose is to bring the  bulk of the land producing wealth under State  ownership or control by the abolition of the system  of land tenure which has been found to be archaic  and non-conducive to the general interest of the  community.. of the gross assets  on the specious pka that the landlords must be  supposed to spend that percentage of their gross  income on works of benefit to the rayats of the  estates and, therefore, that part of the Act is beyond  the legislative competence of the Bihar Legislature.. In the first place the existence of a public  purpose being, as I hold, a provision of article 31 (2),  its absence, if any, in relation to the arrears of  rent cannot, by reason of articles 31 (4), 31-A and  31-B be made a ground of attack against the Act.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. If the acquisition of th~  zamindaries and the tenures is, as I hold, dictated or  inspired by the sound public purpose of ameliorating  the economic and political conditions of the actual  tenants, the self same public purpose may well require  the acquisition of the arrears of rent so as to avert the  undesirable but inevitable consequences I have men- tioned The Bihar Legislature obviouslly thought  that the tenants in arears will have better treatment  and a more reasonable accommodation, in the matter  of the liquidation of the huge arrears, from the State  which will act under the guidance of the Land Com- mission than from the expropriated landlords whose sole  surviving interest in their erstwhile tenants will only  be to realise as much of the arrears as they can from  the tenants and within the shortest possible time  without any mercy or accommodation.. The overriding public purpose of ameliorating  the conditions of the cultivating raya~ may well have  induced the Legislature to treat the arrears of rent  and the decrees for rent differently from the other  ordinary moveable properties of the zamindars or  tenure-holders, e.g., their money in the bank or their  jewellery or ornaments with which the rayats  have no concern and to provide for the acquisition  of the arrears and the decrees.. It is said that the provision in the Act for  the acquisition of arrears of rent is a fraud on the legis- lative power given by the Constitution.. I have already explained that in a scheme of land  <eforms such as is envisaged in the Act the acquisition  of the arrears of rent may properly accompany the  acquisition of the zamindaries and the tenures.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. If the principles so laid down  in the Act do not in any rare case produce any com- pensation or do not produce adequate compensation  in some cases, such absence of compensation may be  a contravention of article 31 (2) but in view of  articles 31 (4), 31-A and 31-B and particularly due to  the words \"notwithstanding anything in this Constitu- tion\" occurring in article 31 ( 4) it cannot be made a  ground of attack on the Act, even though such ground  is formulated in a different but attractive language,  namely, as a fraud on the Constitution.. Article 31 (2) requires that the  law authorising the taking poss,ession or the acquisi- tion of land for public purpose should provide  for compensation for the property taken possession  of or acquired and should either fix the amount or  specify the principles on which, and the manner in  which the compensation is to be determined and given.. The argument is that the Constitution has left to  Parliament or the State Legislature the duty of specify- ing the principle on which, and the form and manner  in which the compensation is to be determined and  given but the Bihar Legislature by section 3 (22) of  the Act has simply provided that the amount of com- pensation shall be paid i:n cash or in bonds or partly  in cash and partly in bonds and that the bonds shall  be either negotiable or non-negotiable and non-trans- ferable and be payable in forty equal instalments and  has 'not laid down any decisive provision but has left  the matter to the State Government to decide.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v .. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. Having laid  down the principle, the Legislature has, by a rule  made under section 43 (3) (p), left it to the Execu- tive to determine the proportion in which the  compensation shall be payable in cash and in  bonds and the manner of such payment of com- pensation.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 1008 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]  of the Union or of a State or for any other public pur- pose is to be determined, and the form and the manner  in which such compensation is to be given.\"  From very early times, law has recognized the right  of Government compulsorily to acquire private pro- perties of individuals for a public purpose and this has  come to be known as the law of eminent domain.. One of  the fundamental objects of every good government  must be the due administration of justice ; and how  vain it would be to speak of such an administration,  when all property is subject to the will or caprice of  the legislature and the rulers.\"  The payment of compensation is an essential ele- ment of the valid exercise of the power to take.. if it sees fit to do so, but it  is not likely that it will be found disregarding it,  without plain expres1sions of such a purpose.\"  This principle is embodied in article 31 (2) of our  Constitution in these terms :- \"~o prop_erty, i:iovable or immovaJ:le, including  any mterest m, or m any company ownmg, any com- mercial or industrial undertaking, shall be taken pos- session of or acquired for public purposes under any  law authorising the taking of such possession or such  acquisition, unless the law provides for compensation  for the property taken possession of or acquired and  either fixes the amount of the compensation, or  specifies the principles on which, and the manner in  which, the compensation JS to be determined and  given.\"  We shall not here trouble ourselves with sub-clauses  (3) and (4) of the article and with articles 31-A and  31-B which were introduced by way of amendment  under the Constitution First Amendment Act, 1951,  dated 18-6-1951.. Das that the payment  of compensation is a concomitant obligation to the  compulsory acquisition of properties by the State can  be accepted as sound ; but when he went further and  urged that it was found in an implicit form in entry 42  of the Concurrent List, he was by no means on sure  ground.. As  just compensation has to be paid when property is  acquired for a public purpose, the legislation has to 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.. It provides :- \"If any Bill pending at the commencement of this  Constitution in the Legislature of a State has, after it  has been passed by such Legislature, beert reserved for  the consideration of the President and has received  his assent, then, notwithstanding anything m this  Constitution, the law so assented to shall not be called  in question in any court on the ground that it contra- venes the provisions of clause (2).\"  The Bill which subsequently became \"The Bihar  Land Reforms Act, 1950\" was pending at the com- mencement of the Constitution in the legislature of  the State, and after it was passed by the legislature,  it was reserved for the consideration of the President  and received his assent.. 1952  The State of  Bihar 1  v.. 1012 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952]  acquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights  therein or for the extinguishment or modification of any  such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ·ground  that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges  any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this  Parr:  Provided that where such law is a law made by the  Legislature of a.. of .. compensation provided in the Act, if he was not  able to convince the Court on his main point that he  could challenge the offending Act on grounds other  than those mentioned in Part III of the Constitution,  and that there was something in entries No. 36 of the  State List and No. 42 of the Concurrent List read  together which · imposed on the State Legislature an  obligation to provide for the payment of just or pro- per compensation and that the non-observance of this l  .•  •  '  •  S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1013  obligation entitles him to challenge the validity of the  Act as unconstitutional.. The  provision of clause (2) is only as regards compen- sation as can be gathered from its latter part :- \"Unless the law provides 'for · compensation for  the property taken possession of or acquired and either  fixes the amount of the compensation, or specifies the  principles on which, and the manner in which, the  compensation is to be determined and given.\"  It is assumed, rightly, that the existence of a public  purpose is · part and parcel of · the law and is inherent  in it.. tillers of the land and confer on them rights of  permanent occupancy and also to bring them directly  into contact with the State, all moneys which the pro- prietors had collected as and by way of rent from  their estates for three years prior to the commence- ment of the Act, shall vest in and be payable to the  State, could it be said by any stretch of reason that  any public purpose had been established for the taking  of the moneys ?. In the present  cases, it is untenable to state that the taking over of  arrears of rent is a natural consequence of the acquisi~  tion of the estates.. 1952  The State of  Bihar  v.",

  "summary": "On his search by  the customs authorities a sum of Rs. 25,000 was recovered from  him which he had not declared in his declaration form and for  which he had no permit from the Reserve Bank of India for  taking out of India.. the offence was taken by the  Additional District Magistrate on February 2, 1953, after the  complaint had been filed and the trial was valid.. The second point urged on hchalf of the  appl'llant was that on 8eptember · 16, 1952, when the  ·S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 95  Magistrate issued the warrant of arrest against the  appellant he could not have done so without having  previously taken congnizance of the offence.. 19 of the Sea Cus­ toms Act (8 of 1878) as it could not be said that at the  moment the appellant was searched by the Customs  Officials, he was taking out of India across any customs  frontier as defined by the Central Government the cur­ rency notes in question.. The version of the appellant as to how the sum of  Rs. 25,000 in currency notes was with him was that  he was not searched at all at the Customs barrier.. It is true that the High Court has taken  a different view to that taken by the trying Magistrate  and has rejected the appellant's case that he had vol­ untarily handed over the currency notes in question to  the Customs Officers in the circumstances mentioned  by him and that he had no intention to take that  money out of India without a permit.. It  found, on the evidence of the Superintendent of the  Reserve Bank, that the Reserve Bank received no  application from the appellant before September 7,  1952, nor had the Reserve Bank granted the permission  to the appellant to take any currency notes out of India.. On arrest, under  the terms of that warrant he was released on bail by  the police with a direction to appear before the court on  September 19.. The main submission on behalf of the appellant was  directed towards establishing that the entire proceed:  ings before the Additional District Magistrate and the  trying Magistrate were without jurisdiction as cogniz­ ance of the offence had been taken on September 16,  1952, in contravention of the provisions of s.. 19(3) of the Foreign Exchange  Regulation Act a District Magistrate or Magistrate of  the first class may, on a representation in writing m.ade  by a person authorized in this behalf by the Central  Government or the Reserve Bank and having reasons  to believe that there had been contravention of any of  the provisions of that Act, issue a search warrant.. Inspector Mitra was so authorized by the Reserve Bank  tm September 11, 1952, and in pursuance of that  authorization applied to the Additional District  Magistrate for the issue of a ·search warrant.. 155,  Cr. P.C. The order of the Additional District Magistrate  directing the issue of a search warrant and the word  \" permitted \" contained t,herein we consider, in the  context of the application, to mean that he granted  the sanction for investigation as asked for.. The Additional  District Magistrate thereon recorded the following order:  \"Seen the complaint filed to day against the  accused Narayandas Bhagwandas Madhavdas under  section 8(2) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act  read with Section 23B thereof read with Section 19 of  the Sea Customs Act and Notification No. ]'.E.R.A.  105/51 dated the 27th February, 1951, as amended,  issued by the Reserve Bank of India under Section  8(2) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act.. On that date the complaint was filed and the  order of the Additional District Magistrate clearly  indicated that he took cognizance of the offence and  sent the case for trial to Mr. Sinha.. Issue search  warrant.\" It was on this date that the Additional  District Magistrate took cognizance of the offence.. C.\"  That is to say, that the Additional District Magistrate  was not being asked to take cognizance of the offence.. In order to facilitate his investigation it was necessary  for him to arrest the appellant and that he could not  do without a warrant of arrest from the Additional  District Magistrate.. There was no legal  bar to the Additional District Magistrate taking cogniz­ ance of the offence on February 2, 1953, as on that  date Inspector Mitra's complaint was one which he  was authorized to make by the Reserve Bank under  s.. If  at the end of the investigation no complaint had been  filed against the appellant the police could have under  the· provisions of s.. 169 of the Code released him on ·  his executing a bond with or without sureties to  appear if and when so required before the Additional  District Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of  the offence on a police report and to try the accused or  commit him for trial.. If, on the other hand, after completing the investig­ ation a complaint was filed, as in this case, it would be  the duty of the Additional District Magistrate then to  enquire whether the complaint had been filed with the  requisite authority of the Reserve Bank as required by  s.. In the present case, as the  requisite authority had been granted by the Reserve  Bank on January 27, 1953, to file a complaint, the  complaint filed on February 2, was one which complied  with the provisions of s.. 23 of the ]foreign Exchange  Regulation Act and the Additional District Magistrate  could take cognizance of the offence which, indeed, he  did on that date.. In our opinion, the proceedings before the Additional  District Magistrate and the trying Magistrate were  with jurisdiction and the trial of the appellant was  legal.",

  "summary": "The State of Punjab, [1957] S.C.R. 953, that the approver's  evidence had to satisfy a double test i.e., he must be a reliable  witness and his evidence must receive sufficient corroboration and  in that the corroborating evidence was not sufficient to connect  the appellant with the crime.. The Sessions Judge had correctly directed the jury that the  corroboration of the evidence of the approver in material parti­ culars must relate not only to the commission of the crime, but  also to the evidence connecting or tending to connect the accused  with the crin1e.. Once there was evidence of such circumstances it was for the jury  to decide whether they were sufficient corroboration of the  approver's evidence that the appellant murdered the deceased.. The conviction of the appellant depended on the  evidence of the approver and the circumstantial  evidence which corroborated him in connecting or  tending or connect the appellant with the murder of  the deceased Sibapada Hati.. It must show that he is a reliable witness and  that his evidence receives sufficient corroboration, (2)  that the evidence of an approver must be confirmed  not only as to the circumstances of the crime but also  as to the identity of the prisoner.. Baskerville (1), (3) that the  circumstantial evidence corroborating the approver  was not sufficient to connect the appellant with the  murder of the deceased and (4) that on similar corrobor­ ation of the approver's testimony the accused J agdish  Gorain had been acquitted.. This Court went on to observe, \" The  argument that the character of the approver's evid­ ence has not been considered by the High Court  cannot be characterised as merely academic or theo­ retical in the present case because, as we shall presently  point out, the evidence of the approver is so thoroughly  discrepant that it would be difficult to resist the  conclusion that the approver in the present case is a  wholly unreliable witness.. It would be  in high degree dangerous to attempt to formulate  the kind of evidence which would be regarded as  corroboration, except to say that corroborative  evidence is evidence which shows or tends to show  that the story of the accomplice that the accused  committed the crime is true, not merely that the  crime has been committed, but that it was commit­ ted by the accused.. \"  In the present case the jury had been clearly directed  by the Sessions Judge that corroborative evidence  must be evidence which implicates the accused, i.e.,  which confirms in some material particulars not only  the evidence that the crime had been committed but  also that the appellant had committed it.. The  Sessions Judge told the jury that \"Corroborative - s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 133  evidence, you should bear in mind, is evidence which  shows or tends to show t\"hat the story of the accomplice  that the accused committed the crime is true.. It is the  approver's evidence which is the direct evidence of the  crime.. It is this corroborative evidence which deter­ mines the _mind of the Court or a jury that the  approver's evidence that the accused committed the  crime is true.. As to the 3rd submission made on behalf of the  appellant the following circumstances were established  by the evidence which were accepted by the jury :  L There was a motive for the appellant to  commit the crime, that is to say, his immoral  proposal to Lila, wife of the deceased.. Indeed, the High Court was of the opinion that these  circumstances independent of the direct evidence of  the approver would not be sufficient to induce any  reasonable person to come to the conclusion that the  appellant had committed the crime.. In addition, the cir·  cumsta.nce that it was the appellant who had called  for the deceased a little after sunset and ha.d·ta.ken  him a.way and thereafter was seen going a.long towards  the north of the village with the deceased and that  thereafter the deceased was not seen a.live was one  upon which the jury could rely in coming to the  conclusion that it connected or tended to connect the  appellant with the crime.",

The Tribunal, inter  alia, held that no relationship of employer and employee existed  between the auction-purchaser and the t:ild staff who had been  discharged prior to the purchase of the business, and the reference  so far as the auction-purchaser was concerned was incompetent.. The liquidators were refused sanction to appeal from the  said award by the High Court whereupon the auction-purchaser  who was also the managing director of the Company, prior to  its liquidation, preferred an appeal in the name of the Company  represented by himself as the managing director and also in his  capacity as the auction-purchaser of the Company.. 457 of the Companies Act 1956, on  the ground that the appeal was not maintainable as it was not  authorised by the High Court.. 14 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)]  r959 No person other than the Official Liquidator, who is placed  in charge of the affairs of the Company in the process of winding  Great Indian up, is authorised with the sanction of the Court to institute any  Motor Works Ltd., suit, prefer an appeal or other legal proceedings in the name and  and Another on behalf of the Company.. 457 of the Com~·anies Act  1956, nor does it do away with the necessity for the requisite  sanction of the court which is a condition precedent so far as the  liquidator is concerned to institute any suit or proceedings in the  name or on behalf of the company in liquidation.. In the instant case the appeal purported to be filed on behalf  of the Company in liquidation through its managing director was  wholly incompetent ; an.d the second appellant, the auction­ purchascr, could not be said to the aggrieved party enabling him  to invoke s.. The v.. N nndy, in his capacity as the credit.or of Their Employees  the Company and/or as the auction-purchaser of the and Others  Company, is the second appellant.. In April, 1953, the list of the creditors of rea n tan  Motor works Ltd .• the Company was settled by the Court, and the second  and Another appellant aforesaid, was included in the list as a  v.. The second appellant bid for the  purchase of the business with the leave of the Court,  and he was declared the highest bidder and purchaser  of the business for Rs. 1,42,500 at the sale held on  June 12, 1954.. On July 24,  the Official Liquidators put the appellant No. 2, the  auction-purchaser, in possession of the busi!'1e~s of the  Company, which is now being carried on by the second  appellant as the sole proprietor.. , As a result of the termination of the services of the  one hundred and forty two employees of the Company,  as aforesaid, an industrial dispute was raised at the  instance of the said employePs whose list is attached  to the order of Reference, dated August 26, 1954,  which is in these terms:- \"Whereas an Industrial dispute exists between (1)  Messrs.. By order of the Governor.\"  The employees of the Company had moved the High  Court for directions to the Liguidators for the  payment of their dues from the Company.. It will be noticed from the order of reference, quoted  above, that besides the Official Liquidators, the second  appellant was also impleaded as a party to the Refe­ rence, in his capacity as the auction-purchaser of the  Company.. It  may be noted here that the proceedings before the  Industrial Tribunal had commenced without the  necessary sanction of the High Court in the liquida­ tion proceedings, but during the pendency of the  proceedings, the High Court, by its order dated Decem­ ber 20, 1955, granted leave to the workmen to proceed  with and continue the proceedings against the Official  Liquidators of the Company.. The dismissal of the appeal on the ground of  the appeal not being competent; was based on the  order of the Calcutta High Court, dated April 30, 1956,  aforesaid, refusing leave to the Liquidators to prefer  an appeal.. It is noteworthy that the appeal before  the Appellate Tribunal, was not by the Liquidators  but by K.D. N undy as Managing Director of the Com­ pany, as also by him in his capacity as the creditor or  contributory or as the auction-purchaser of the Com­ pany.. 457, it is only the  Liquidator who is authorized with the sanction of the  Court, to institute any suit or other legal proceedings  in the name and on behalf of the company.. Thus,  there is no inconsistency between the aforesaid provi­ sions of the Act and the Companies Act, which only  laid down a condition precedent to the filing of an  appeal, if it has to be, by a Liquidator of a company  in the process of winding up.. As, in the instant case, the Court refused the  necessary sanction to the Liquidators to prefer the  appeal, no appeal could have been filed on behalf of  the Company.. The Tribunal put this on three main grounds-(1) that  the auction-purchaser had purchased the business of  the Company free from all encumbrances, out-goings  and liabilities, (2) that tho employment of the work­ men had been terminated hy the Liquidators before  possession of the business was delivered to the auction­ purchaser, and (3) that there was no relationship of  employer and employees between the auction-purchaser  and the workmen whose services were so terminated.. The Tribunal, in that view of the matter, declared  the Reference to be incompetent in so far as the  auction-purchaser was concerned.",

They show that when the enquiry was held  on March 12, certain persons, whose statements  had been recorded by the manager in the absence of  Das during the course of what may be called investi­ gation by the company were present.. Further his  evidence does not show that t.he statements which had  been recorded were read over to Das at the enquiry  before he was asked to question the witnesses.. 507 :- \" Stating it broadly and without intending it to  be exhaustive, it mav be observed that rules of natu­ ral justice require th.~t a party should have the oppor­ tunity •>f a<ldueing all relevant evidence on which he  relies, that the evidence of the opponent should bC'  taken in his presence, and tha.t he should be given the  opportunity of cro::;s,examining the witnesses exa.min­ ed by that party, and that no materials should be  relied on agairnit him without his being given an  opportunity of explaining them.\"  It will he immediately clear that these principles  were not followed in the enquiry which took place  on March 12, inasmuch as the witnesses on which  the company relied were not examined in the presence  of Das.. (\"), this Court held that \" rule;; of  natural justice vary \\vith the varying con;;titutions of  statutory bodies and the rules prescribed by the legis­ lature under which they have to act, and the ques­ tion whether in a particular case they have been  contravened must be judged not by any preconceiv­ ed notion of what they may be but in the light of  the provisions of the relevant Act\".. That was, however, a case in which the police officer  making the report was not required to be cross­ examined; on the other hand, the party concerned was  informed about the material sought to be used against  him and was given an opportunity to explain it.. copies of the statements of witnesses who had given  evidence against Das were supplied to him or even  that the statements made by the witnesses to the  manager were read out, in extenso to Das before he  was asked to question them.. In-these circumstances  one of the basic principles of natural justice in an  enquiry of this nature was not observed, and, there­ fore, the finding of the Tribunal that proper procedure  had not been followed is justified and is not open to  challenge.. The defect in the conduct of the enquiry could have  been cured if the company had produced the witnesses  before the Tribunal and given an opportunity to Das  to cross-examine them there.. 33 of  the Act for permission to dismiss an employee, he  could make good the defect by producing all relevant  evidence which would hare been examined at the  enquiry, before the tribunal, in which case the tribunal  would consider the evidence and decide whether per­ mission should be granted or not.",

The Allthority  was disposed to take the view that having regard to  the nature of the work assigned to the progress time­ keepers they must be held to be persons employed in  work incidental to, or connected with the manufac­ turing process or the subject of the manufacturing  process and as such they are workers within the mean­ ing of s.. 2(1) of the Factories Act.. In the result, the  finding made by the Authority was that timekeepers  are employees of the workshop, but are not workers  under the Factories Act ; while the progress time­ keepers can claim the status of workers under the  said Act.. 2(1) of  the Factories Act.. It is true that the finding of the  Authority in respect of the timekeepers is against the  respondents; but Mr. Purshottam says that he is  entitled to support the final order passed by the  Authority on the additional ground that the time­ keepers, like the progress timekeepers, are workers  under s.. 70 of the Act the  respondents would be entitled to overtime wages  under s..

It is not disputed by the appellant  that the Bombay Legislature was competent to  prescribe for the extension of the provisions of the  Factories Act to employees in the factories within the  territory of the State of Bombay; and since sanction  for this legislation has been duly obtained from the  Governor-General of India on January 3, 1949('), no  question about ll.ny repugnance between the provi­ sions of s.. 70 supplement  the provisions of the Factories Act by extending them  to all employees in factories like the respondents  though they are not workers under s.. It is true that the definition of \"establish­ ment\" does not expressly exclude factory ; but it is  plain that factory is treated by the Act as separate and  distinct and there can be no doubt that the provisions  in the Act which apply to establishment are not  intended to, and do not, apply to factories.. It is conceivable that a kitchen  attached to an establishment like a residential hotel  may satisfy the definition of factory ; but it seems to  us that such an adjunct of an establishment is prima  facie not intended by the Act to be treated apart and  separately from the main establishment itself; and so  it would be taken as a part of the establishment and  be governed by the provisions of the Act in relation  thereto.. 4 of  the Act.. 3 of the said schedule  shows that the provisions of the Act are inapplicable  to the said establishments..

It  appears from the record that these notices were compli­ ed with, but on February 26, 1951 the Income-tax  Officer included the sum of Rs. 59,026 in the total in­ come of the assessee and assessed him on it for the  assessment year 1945-46.. 34 of  the Act had no retrospective effect, and that the  assessment completed on February 26, 1951 was in­ valid, inasmuch as it was completed four years after  the end of the relevant assessment year.. These questions  were:·  \"(1) Whether the notice issued under Section 34  of the Act by the Income-tax Officer on 27-2-1950,  S.C.R.

(a) the Income-tax Officer has reason to believe  that.by reason of the omission or failure· on the part  of an assessee to make a return of his income under  section 22, for any year ....... \"  It would appear from this that if the return filed on  January 5, 1950, was a return of income, there was no  failure or omission on the part of the asscssee, so as to  bring the matter within s.. But if the return made by the assessee was no  return at all, then the conditions under the first sub­ section of s.. 34 obtained, and the assessment could he  completed within one year of the date of service of the  notice (l\\Iarch 3, 1950), i.e. on or before March 2, 1951.. his  total income and tot.ti world income during that  year: • * * (2) In the case of any person whose total income  is, in the Income-tax Officer's opinion, of such an  amount as to render such person liable to income­ tax, the Income-tax Officer may serve a notice upon  him requiring him to furnish, within such period,  not being less than thirty days .... his total income and total world income  during the prov ions year: • • •  (3) If any person has not furnished a return with­ in the time allowed l1y or under sub-section (I) or  sub-section (2), or having furnished a return under  either of those sub-sections, discovers any omission  or wrong statement thprein, he may furnish a return  or a revised return, as the case may be at any time  before the assessment is made.\"  It will be seen from this, that, as the Bombay High  Court correctly pointed out, there is a time limit  provided in sub-ss.. The con­ troversy centres round the fact that the return, when  it was filed, disclosed an income which was below the  maximum not chargeable to tax, and the question is  whether in such an event the Income-tax Officer was  precluded from issuing a notice under s.. 34 of the Act.. Commissioner of of Income-tu,  Income-tax (2) and the decision under appeal here, while Bombay  the Calcutta view is to be found in Commissioner of v.. 22(2) of the Act) was served, and  a return showing an income below the taxable  minimum was filed.. A return which showed no assessable  income, could not possibly be 'treated' as a return  filed under section 24(1) or a return called for under  that section but filed under section 24(3), when in  fact it was filed in response to a notice under section  24(2).\"  The opinion here expressed was criticised in the  judgment under appeal, and in the next case,  R.. 449 :  \" 'It should be remembered', I observed 'that the  return in the present case is being sought to be  treated as a return under section 24(1), belatedly  filed.' And then I went on to say that a return  under section 24(1) would only be filed by a person  who thought that he had a taxable income and  therefore a return showing an income below the  taxable limit could not be held, on a construction  thereof, to be a return under section 24(1) and  consequently the return in the case we were then  considering could not be treated as such a return  filed under section 24(3).. To say that, was not to  say that even a return filed in compliance with a  notice under section 22(2), if filed belatedly under  section 22(3) could not be a return showing an  income below the taxable limit.''  This left the matter somewhat ambiguous as to what  was really meant, and in Commissioner of Income-f,ax  v.. That section,  they opined, contemplated the filing of a return of  taxable income, and a return not showing such income  was not a return at all in law.. The notice under s..

In the assessment year  no return of income was filed, nor was any notice  served under s..

  "summary": "The dispute arose regarding  the payment of bonus in 1953· The workmen claimed that the  sole object of bonus which had been grantecf to them upto that year  was to meet puja expenses and that the payment of this bonus  had become customary and a term of employment.. Held, that the workmen were not entitled to puja bonus as  an implied term of employment for an implied agreement could  not be inferred when the appellant had made it clear that the  payments from 1948 to 1952 were ex gratia ; but they were  entitled to puja bonus on the basis that it was a customary and  traditional payment.. In determining whether the payment was  customary and traditional the following circumstances have to be  established :  (i) that the payment has been made over an unbroken series  of years; ,  (ii) that it has been for a sufficiently long period, the  period has to be longer than in the case of an implied term of  employment;  (iii) that it has been paid even in years of loss and did not  depend on the earning of profits ; and  (iv) that the payment has been made at a uniform rate  throughout.. The workmen then contended in their letter of Septem­ ber 21, 1953 that the sole object of bonus which had, been  granted upto that year was to meet puja expenses and  that the payment of this bonus had become customary  and a term of employment.. The  decision of the Appellate Tribunal has also mixed the  two aspects of puja bonus, namely, whether it is based  on an implied term of employment or on custom; but  it came to the conclusion that there was sufficient  evidence to establish custom and therefore ordered  payment of one month's basic wages as puja bonus.. In the present case it has been pointed out by  the company that payments which had been made in  the past years from 1940 to 1952 could not be con­ sidered as based on an implied term 0£ employment in  the circumstances of this case.. bonus than may be the case with puja bonus based on  an implied term of employment; (iii) the circumstance  that the payment depended upon the earning of profits  would have to be excluded and therefore it must be  shown that payment was made in years of loss.. At that time it was said  on behalf of the company before the industrial  tribunal that some bonus was being paid and that  there was no intention to discontinue it and conse­ quently .the tribunal did not adjudicate upon the  matter, which shows that the company recognised the  traditional and customary nature of the payment and  it assured the tribunal that there was no intention  then to discontinue the payment.. The  chairman of the board of directors of the company  visited Calcutta in 1952 and then on the represehtation  of the workmen the advance was converted into one  month's bonus and even those workmen who had not  accepted the advance were allowed to draw the bonus.. It cannot therefore be said that there was any break  in the payment of bonus from 1940 to 1952, for if the  chairman had not converted what was advance of pay  into bonus in December 1952, the workmen might  ha.. It was pointed out that in  four years during this period the payment was made  in November and December and not about the time of  the pujas; and, therefore, it could not be said that  this was traditional and customary puja bonus.. The  delay in payment is not in our opinion material in  this case, for one of the directors of the company, who  appeared as a witness, stated as to this one month's  bonus that it was paid by the company to help its  staff during pujas.",

The reasonableness  of the restriction was to be judged at the time it was challenged  and in the context of the circumstances then existing.. The  notification of the Central Government increasing the price of  sugar to enable the recoupment of the loss occasioned by the  export could be taken into consideration in judging the  reasonableness of the restrictions.. In testing the reasonableness of the Sugar Mills Ltd.,  restrictions imposed by the impugned Act it was not permissible and Another  to take into consideration the notification under the Sugar v.. The restrictions imposed by the impugned Act were not  unreasonable as the j_ct served the national interest by earning  foreign exchange for the State and building up foreign markets  for the future prosperity of the sugar industry.. Though in deciding the  reasonablene1>s of the restrictions imposed by the impugned Act  all the prevailing conditions and circumstances had to be  considered, the notification increasing the home price of sugar  could not be taken into consideration.. Besides, there was nothing in the Essential Commodities  Act or the Sugar (Control) Order which authorised the Govern­ ment to increase the price for the sake of recouping to the  manufacturers the loss caused to them by the impugned Act, and  the validity of the notification increasing the home price of sugar  was doubtful.. Both the Ordinance and the Act were passed to  provide for the export of sug~ir in the pi.1blic interest.. To achieve this objective, the Act; :111thorises  the Centl'al Government (as did the Orcliuance pre­ viously) to specify an export agency to perform the  functions mentioned in the Ad., and the Central  Government by a not.ification issued the r-;amc day,  specified the Indian Sugar Mills Association (Export  Agency Division) Calcutta, as the export agency.. The Aet next provides that the Central Government  may by notification in the Officia.l Gazette, fix the  quantity of sugar to be .. exported during any period  taking into consideration :  (a) the quantity of sugar available in the country;  (b) the quantity of sugar rec1uired for consump­ tion in the country ; and  ; (c) the necessity of exporting sugar with a view to  earning foreign exchange in the public interest,  but, so as not to exceed 20 per cent.. Section 5 of the Act enables the Central Govemment  The Union of India to apportion, by order in writing, the quantity to be  and Another exported among \" owners \" of factories, the word  Hidayatullah 1.. The apportionment of the  quantity of sugar to be exported is to be in proportion  to the quantity of sugar produced or likely to be  produced by the owners during the season referred to  earlier.. On the communication of the m-der to an  owner, the quantity so apportioned is deemed to be  the export quota for the factory ofthat owner.. Section 6 then provides that on demand by the  export agency, every owner shall deliver to it from  time to time, sugar procluced in his factory in such  quantities (not exceeding in the aggregate his export  quota fixed for the factory or group of factories, as the  case may be), of such grade, in such manner, within  such time and at such place, as may be specified by the  export agency in this behalf.. 9 of the  Act.. as the said quantity), there  shall be levied and collected on so much of the sugar  despatched from the factory for consumption in India  as is equal to the said quantity, a duty of excise at  the rate of seventeen rupees per maund.. 8(1) \"The export agency shall take all practical  measures to export sugar delivered to it under this  Act:  Provided that, if the export agency is of opinion  that having regard to the quality of the sugar deliver­ ed to it by any owner, or to the expenses involved in  transporting.. the sugar from one place to another, or  to the delay likely to be involved in exporting it,.or to  the conditions prevailing in the markets for sugar,  whether in or out of India, or to any other relevant  circumstance, it is expedient so to do, the export agency  may sell the whole or any part of the sugar in India  46 SUPREME COURT REPOHTS [1960(1)]  '959 >md may, if it thinks fit, purchase such quantity of  - sugar as it may co1'.sider necessary for export at the -TheLordf\\.rishna · t t'' •  Sugar ,1till8 Ltd., <.1})J.)ro11r1a e .1n1e..

In evaluating such elusive  factors and forming their own conception of what is  reasonable, in all the circumstances of a given case,  it is inevitable that the social philosophy and the  scale of values of the judges participating in the deci­ sion should play an important part, and the limit to  their interference with legislative judgment in such  cases can only be dictated by their sense of respon­ sibility and self-restraint and the sobering reflection  that the Constitution is meant not only for people of  their way of thinking but for all, and that the major­ ity of the elected representatives of the people have,  in authorising the imposition of the restrictions, con­ sidered them to be reasonable.\"  In Virendra v.. The Lord Krishna  It cannot but be accepted that the Government sugar Mills Ltd.,  made adequate arrangements to recoup the sugar and Another  industry for the loss which it might suffer in giving .y.. There is nothing  in the record of the case to show that the Mills were  not able to sell their sugar at the controlled price.. The restriction  was not unreasonable, because arrangement was made  to save the owners of the factories from loss, and the  loss entailed by the export of sugar was to be borne  by the consumers in India and not by the producers.. If the object and purpose of the  Act is valid and also is in the public interest, there  being no disadvantage to the owners ultimately, s.. paym.ent of the price should be concurrent conditions, The Union of India  that is to say, that the buyer should be ready and andAnother  willing to pay the price in exchange for possession of Hidayatullah 1.. The object and purpose of the Act is to  export sugar and to divide the receipts less expenses,  among the owners who supply sugar for export.. In the present cases, there  was a demand for delivery of the sugar of the quota,  and that has not been met.. The condition that the sale-proceeds are payable to  the export agency is perfectly valid, regard being had  to the scheme of the export and the advantage allowed  on all sales in India.. The .. \"in fixing such  quantity the Central Government shall have regard to  -(a) the quantity of sugar available in India, (b) the  the quantity of sugar which, in its opinion, would be  reasonably required for consumption in India, (c) the  necessity for exporting sugar with a view to earning  foreign exchange in the public interest.\" Section 5  requires the Central Government to apportion the  quantity fixed under s.. Section 6 provides that every owner of  a factory shall, on demand by the export agency  deliver to it sugar upto its export quota and on delivery  \" the owner shall retain no rights in respect of such  sugar except his right to receive payment therefor  under section 9.\" Section 7 makes provision for an  additional excise duty being levied in certain circum­ stances on the quantity of sugar by which the sugar  delivered by the owner of a factory falls short of its  export quota.. Section 8 states that the export agency  shall export the sugar delivered to it, provided that in  certain circumstances specified, the export agency may  sell that sugar in India and may if it thinks fit pur-·  chase other sugar for export and for this purpose permit  the owner to sell the whole or part of its export .quota  at a price approved, on condition t.hat the sale proceeds  are paid to it.. It is not necessary to refer  to the other provisions of the Act.. The petitioners were thereafter asked by and Another  the export agency to sell the sugar and pay the sale- v.. It appears that t.l1e export agency felt that the  petitioners were neither going to sell the sugar and pay  the sale proceeds nor to deliver the sugar and it there- upon pointed out to the petitioners that they were hy  their conduct exposing themRelves to the risk of  having to pay the additional excise duty under s.. From the provisions of the Act earlier set out, it is  quite clear that it requires the owner of .a sugar factory  to part with a portion of the produce of his factory in  exchange for an amount to he fixed under the provi­ sions of s.. The substance of the matter then is that an owner  of a sugar factory gets in exchange for the sugar deli­ vered by him under the Act, a proportionate share of  the sale-proceeds less the Pxpenses.. Jain, Chief  Director, Directorate of Sugar, affirmed on February 13,  1959 and filed on behalf of the Government, to show  that the Act contemplated that the export of sugar  made under it would result in a loss.. In the Objects  & Reasons of the Act it is stated,  \"With a view to earning foreign exchange it is  necessary to promote export of sugar.. in the Act depends on the pooling of the losses on and Another '  export by all sugar factories in India, in proportion to v.. their export quota.'' The Union of India  We then get to this that on the respondents' own and Another  case the exports under the Act can he made only at a· Sakrar J.. It is said that the  Act was passed with a view to earn foreign exchange  by export of sugar.. On the other hand, the contention of  the respondents is for reasons to be presently stated that  the Act really caused no loss and that being so the  restrictions imposed by it cannot he said to be un­ rea.sonable.. Indeed, it is said in  these affidavits that the scheme of the Act is bnsed on  the pooling of the losses caused by the exports made  under it.. It is then said that the loss caused by the Act was  recouped by an order made by the Government in­ creasing the home price of the sugar and therefore in  fact the manufacturers suffered no loss.. The process  of recoupment was thus stated in paragraph 14 of the  said main affidavit of Shri Jain:  \" The incidence of loss on the first quota of 50,000  tons fixed by the Government was assessed and when  the Central Government fixed the price of sugar for  internal consumption under the provisions of the  Essential Commodities Act and the Sugar (Control)  70 f;UPREME <'OORT HEPOHTS [i!l60(1)]  Order, 1955, they gave adjustment in price by adding  50 nP.. It is s1tid that in the  circumstances that prevail, namely, the increase in the  homo price, the restrictions imposed by the impugned  .\\ct cannot he said to be unreasonable, for on the whole  they occasion no loss.. I will assume that the Notification increasing the  price was issued with the object of recouping the loss  caused by the impugned Act as stated in the affidavit  of Shri ,Jain, though the Notification itself does not  say so.. The question then is, is the increase in the  home price of sugar made by the Government by a  Notification issued under the powers given to it by  another Act which has the effect of wiping out the loss  inflicted by the impugned Act, a circumstance which  makes the restrictions imposed by the latter Act  reasonable?. It is said that this is so ; that in judging the reason­ ableness of the restriction imposed by one Act, it is  permissible to consider an order made by the executive  Government under another Act.. 607:  \"The nature of the right alleged to have been  infringed, the underlying purpose of the restrictions  imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought  to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the  (1) (1952) S.C.R. 597·  72 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)]  '959 imposition, the prevailing conditions at the time, should  TlieLm·d lfri.<lmn all enter into the judicial verdict.\"  SuKar Mill.< Ud., I respectfully agree with all that the learned Chief  and A.wt'\"' Justice sairl, but 1 am unable to see that this advances  Tl U .. I entirely agree that in deciding the reasonableness  of the restrictions imposed by a statute, all the prevail­ ing conditions and all the circumstances of the case  S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 73  have to be considered.. I  find nothing in the Essential Commodities Act nor  naturally in the Sugar (Control) Order, 1955, which  would authorise the Government to increase the  price simply for the sake of recouping to the manu­ facturers the loss caused to them by the impugned  Act.. If it is said that the Notifica­ tion was issued for the purposes mentioned in the  Essential Commodities Act, it becomes at once apparent,  that the price fixed under it has no relation to the  impugned Act and may have to be altered irrespective  of the latter Act.. It is therefore contend- ed that the restrictions imposed by the Act must be  presumed to be reasonable and the petitioners cannot  be heard to say that they are not.. I think it/ right also to say that there is no material  on the record whatever to lmtd to the conclusion that  the Association had agreed to the Act being passed in  the form in which it stands.. 'bonus' to the cane growers or in lowering the price of  sugar for home consumption.\"  It is clear from the suggestions thus made by the  manufacturers that they wanted the burden on them  to be relieved and export at Government's cost.. It appears however that various  representatives of the Government and the sugar  manufacturers met and decided upon the idea of export­ ing sugar for earning foreign exchange in Government's  inkrest and getting a foothold in the world market in  the int~rests of the manufacfurers.. However to provide an element of stability to the  market releases for internal sale shall be regulated by  Government of India in active consultation with the  industry.\"  So what the trade had agreed to was that they  would be prepared to export sugar provided they were  left free to recoup from the internal sales the loss  caused by the export.. saying that the Act would stabilise the sugar industry,  The Union of India the affidavits used on behalf of the respondents do not  and .1no1hu show how that would be done or that there was any  Sarkar].. 4 of the Act.. Under that section, in fixing  the total quantity of wgar to be exported in any  season regard is to be had only to the quantity avail­ able in India, the quantity required for consumption  in India and the necessity of earning foreign exchange.. Again, it  is not out of the excess of the production over the  internal consumption alone that the exports are to be  made.. '  S.O.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 79  I therefore come to the conclusion that the Act I959  which makes the petitioners suffer a loss on the sale The Lord Krishna  of a part of their produce imposes a restriction on Sugar Mills Ltd.,  their right to carry on their business which cannot in and Another  the circumstances of this case he said to be reasonable v.. It is  said that the Central Government in fixing the price  for sugar produced during the season 1957-58, in  vacuum pan sugar factories situate in the areas speci­ fied in the order had taken into account the possible  loss the exporters might incur by reason of the applica­ tion of the provisions of the impugned Act.. The  nature of the right alleged to have been infringed, the  underlying purpose of the restrictions imposed, the  extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied  thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the pre­ vailing conditions at the time, should all enter into the  judicial verdict.. Constitution is meant not only for p<>ople of their way  of thinking but for all, and that the mnjority of the  elected representatives of the people have, in authoris­ ing the imposition of the restrictions, considered them  to be reasonable.\"  If I may say so with respect, this passage summarizes  the law on the subject folly and precisely.. J., contended that the said words  were comprehensive enough to take in notifications  issued by the Government., and, therefore, the said  order of the Central Government fixing the rate would  be one of the elements to be taken into consideration  in testing the reasmmbleness of the impugnl'd Act.. If two or  more Acts were parts of the same scheme or plan, to  implement the same or common objective, or if the  impugned Act, though it was not originally conceived  at the time when the earlier Act was passed, was only  an extension or a further step by legislature for  implementing the object of the earlier Act or if the  legislature by express reference incorporated in the  impugned Act the provisions of the earlier Act, it  would be permissible to rely upon the said provisions  of the earlier Act, not because they formed part of the  prevailing ·conditions but because either the earlier  Act formed part of the impugned Act by reference or  both of them formed part of the same legislative plan.. 5  of the Order made thereunder was to off-;;et the loss  expected to be incurred under the Ordinance, and  therefore, the Act whi('h supplanted the Ordinance,  must be deemed to have been pn,ssed on the basis of  that notification.. time the quantity of sugar which may be exported  during any period, and, in fixing such quantity, the  Central Government should have regard to the  quantity of sugar available in India, the quantity of  sugar which, in its opinion, would be reasonably  required for consumption in India, and the necessity  for exporting sugar with a view to earning foreign  excl;iange in the public interest.. In exercise of that  power, the Central Government should not fix the  quantity of sugar for export as to exceed in any year  in the aggregate twenty per cent.. :'-iection 6 enjoins on the owners of  sugar factories to deliver to the export agency,  appointed under the Act, the sugar produced in their  factories in such quiintities, of such grade, in such  manner, within such time and iit such place, as may  be specified hy the export agency in that behalf.. Section 8 empowers the export  agency, after taking delivery, to export the sugar or  permit the owner to sell the whole or any part of the  export quota in his custody at a price approved by it  on condition that the sale-proceeds are payable to it.. 7(1): Where sugar delivered by any owner  falls short of the export quota fixed for it by any  quantity (hereinafter referred to as the said quantity),  there shall be levied and collected on so much of the  sugar despatched from the factory for consumption in  India as is equal to the said quantity, a duty of excise  at the rate of seventeen rupees per maund.\"  Sub-ss.. The object is  to provide for the export of sugar in the interest of  public and that object is sought to be achieved by  fixing the quota of sugar for export and distributing  the same among the owners of factories; subject to the  condition that in no case it should exceed twenty per  cent.. The quota delivered, or in case the owner is allowed to  sell the sugar himself, the sugar purchased from the  sale-proceeds, is· exported, and the nett sale-proceeds  are distributed among the owners in proportion to the  quantity of sugar delivered by them for export.. The object of the legislature is to  provide for the export of sugar in public interest.. The object of the  Act was, therefore, demorrntrably to serve the national  interest and the scheme evolved certainly had relation  to the object sought to he achieved, for all the pro­ visions of the Act were conceived in :t glmuine attempt  to induce foreign export in sugar by co-operative effort.. The  correspondence between the State and the industry  shows that the industry as a whole co-operated with  the State in evolving the scheme, which culminated in  the passing of the Act.. In the affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents  an attempt was made to support the Act on the  ground that it was intended to serve a dual purpose  of stablising the internal market and earn foreign  exchange for the country.. An attempt was also  made to link the one with the other, but the learned  Attorney-General did not pursue that line in his  argument, and I have, therefore, considered the ques­ tion only from the st.andpoint of the compelling need  of the State to earn foreign exchange, and the long  range aim of the industry to build up a foreign market.",

  "summary": "In resisting the workmen's claim for bonus for the year  1955-56 the appellant contended that in calculating gross profits  for the purpose of the Full Bench formula the following items of  income should be excluded :- (i) Income earned by way of rent, light and power ;  (ii) estate revenue derived from sale of excess coconuts used  in preparing oil grown in the appellant's groves;  (iii) profit from sale of empty barrels ; and  (iv) sale proceeds of tin cans, scraps, Jogs, planks, gunnies  etc.. The appellant also claimed that a profit of Rs. 3 lacs appear­ ing in the accounts due to a change in the method of valuation  was no real profit due to the efforts of Jabour and should not be  taken into account.. Held, that the four items were earned by the appellant in  the normal cour1>e of its business and could not be excluded from  the gross profits on the ground that it had not been proved that  thev were the result of the direct efforts of labour in the bonus  y~a·r.. Its TVorkmen and  Others The profit of Rs. 3 lacs due to change in the method of  accounting was extraneous income and had to be excluded.. WANCHOO J.-This is an appeal by special leave  against the award of the Industrial Tribunal, Bombay,  in a dispute between the Tata Oil Mills Co. Ltd.,  Bombay (hereinafter !\"eferred to as the company)  and its workmen, in the matter of profit bonus (or the  year 1955-56.. Next it claimed that a profit  of Rs. 3 lacs appearing in the accounts due to the  change in the method of valuation was no real profit  due to the efforts of labour and should not be taken  into account in arriving at the available surplus.. The reason given by the Tribunal for disallowing these  items was that they formed part of the profits earned  in the course of the company's business .and there was  no goocl reason for deducting them from the profits.. the ground that they are extraneous income unrelated  to the efforts of the workmen.. Shali­ mar Rope Works Ltd., Shalimar, Howrah(2) by observ­ ing at page 372 that \" it is however too late in the  day to question tlie view that there are profits un- ~ related to workers' efforts and referred to as 'extraneous  profits' and that such profits must be left out of  account in deciding the question whether there is  available surplus in any particular year.\" Income  received by way of rent of quarters and by sale of  scrap-materials has generally been treated as extra­ neous income by the industrial tribunals on the basis  of these decisions of the Labour Appellate Tribunal.. fits part of which are due to the contribution which  the workmen make in increasing production.\"  It was fort.lier observed at page 999- \"lt is therefore cle.ar that the claim for bonus  can be made by the employees only if as n result of  the joint contribution of capital and labour the indus­ t.rinl concern has earned profits.. It is this last condition  which seems to have been relied upon by industrial •  tribunals in holding that there must be direct ctmnec­ tion hetween the efforts of labour and the profits, and  unless that direct connection is established the profits  must be treated as unrelated to the efforts of labour  and thus become extraneous income.. There is no  doubt that there must be contribution of the workmen  in earning profits before they are entitled to profit  bonus; but it wa.s not laid down in the Muir Mills \\ Case(') that direct connection between the efforts of the  workmen and the particular item of profit earned must  be established before the profit can be taken into  account for the purposes of arriving at the available  (1) 1955 (1) S.C.R. 991.. Even so, it may be recognized that there Others  may be instauees of extraneous income for the pur­ pose of the ]'ull Bench formula due (i) either to some  part of the profits not having bee°t earned in that year,  (ii) or to some part of profits arising out of fortuitous  circumstances altogether unconnected with the efforts  of labour.. But apart from these cases, we  cannot see how income arising during the year in the  normal course of business of the concern can be called  extraneous income merely on the ground that no direct  connection between the efforts of labour and the  accrual of the income has been established.. An  instance of the second kind is to be found in the profit  of Rs. 3 lacs made in this year by a change in the  method of valuation of the company's assets, which is  entirely unconnected with the efforts of labour.. But so  far as the other four items are concerned, they are  earned by the company in the normal course of its  business and there is no reason why they should be  excluded on the ground that it has not been proved  that they are the result of direct efforts of labour in  this year.. In short, income  by way of rent, light and power arises in the normal  course of business of the concern and there is no reason  why a direct contribution by labour during the year  in question must be insisted upon in the case of such  income.. These items may be taken together, for  the nature of the receipt is the same, though on account  of the method of accounting employed, the income in  the case of barrels is shown as profit while in the case  of scrnps etc., it is shown as sale proceeds.. Whatever is the income from the sale of these barrels  is in reality a reduction in the cost price of chemicals  to the company, though by the method of accounting  employed it may appear as profit on the sale of  barrels.. In the  Wanchooj, circumstances this income of Rs. 3 lacs must be treated  as extraneous income and excluded for the purpose of  calculations based on the Full Bench formula.. The liquidators were refused sanction to appeal from the  said award by the High Court whereupon the auction-purchaser  who was also the managing director of the Company, prior to  its liquidation, preferred an appeal in the name of the Company  represented by himself as the managing director and also in his  capacity as the auction-purchaser of the Company.",
